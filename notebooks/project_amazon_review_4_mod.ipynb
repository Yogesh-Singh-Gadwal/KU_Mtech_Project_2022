    "test = 'Stop kissing frogs üê∏ üê∏ üê∏ üê∏ I\\'ve been trying Paleo/grain-free cookbooks since I first discovered this healthy way of eating earlier this year. . .and I\\'ve kissed a lot of frogs.<br /><br />One sold here on Amazon [[ASIN:0578116405 Satisfying Eats: Grain Free, Sugar Free & Hunger Free Cookbook]] has a strange warm-and-fuzzy cult following and an undeserved rating (from her groupies, I think) that I fell for.  First I bought the Kindle edition (for my iPad) that was so full of quirks and glitches that it was practically useless, so I ordered the hard copy only to learn that it (1st edition) was LOADED with mistakes.  The author posted an errata on her website that was just as confusing as the mistakes in the cookbook.  I should have sent it back. The few things I did make from the cookbook where an utter disaster, especially the bread/muffin/cookie things.<br /><br />I also got the Wheat Belly Cookbook that\\'s loaded with truly awful recipes, including the basic bread recipe that went directly into the trash after cutting the first slice.  I sent this one back [[ASIN:1936608863 Make it Paleo: Over 200 Grain Free Recipes For Any Occasion]] because it was nothing special and hopelessly repetitive.<br /><br />However, I\\'ve finally found my prince.  This cookbook is a gem.  The author\\'s \\\\\\\\\"World-Famous Sandwich Bread\\\\\\\\\" is the new benchmark for all grain-free everyday sandwich loaves - it\\'s as close to wheat flour bread as any I\\'ve tasted.  And I could happily live the rest of my life eating only \\\\\\\\\"Slow Cooker Sesame-Orange Chicken\\\\\\\\\" over \\\\\\\\\"Coconut-Lime Rice\\\\\\\\\" (cauliflower rice like no other - you\\'ll be fooled).  Best of all, the Kindle version on my iPad works perfectly - no quirks or glitches.  Every recipe has a picture, and even the index has a thumbnail picture of every single recipe.<br /><br />If you get only one Paleo cookbook, make it this one.<br /><br />PS -- A tip from me for a better-looking loaf of the \\\\\\\\\"World-Famous Sandwich Bread\\\\\\\\\" ==> [[ASIN:B0017Z0EW6 Fat Daddio\\'s Anodized Aluminum Bread Pan, 7.75 Inch x 3.75 Inch x 2.75 Inch]] is the PERFECT pan to bake the bread in - you\\'ll get small square slices, instead of wide/shallow rectangular slices.  Be sure to get the 7.75-inch x 3.75-inch x 2.75-inch size.7.75 Inch x 3.75 Inch x 2.75 Inch]] is the PERFECT pan to bake the bread in - you\\'ll get small square slices, instead of wide/shallow rectangular slices.  Be sure to get the 7.75-inch x 3.75-inch x 2.75-inch size.'"
